By default, to use reCAPTCHA you need JavaScript snippet or at least non-JavaScript code which is an iframe tag.
So what if you need only the reCAPTCHA image, is it possible? The answer is yes.

All you need to do is:

1. Get the image url and the challenge string from reCAPTCHA API.
2. Display the image as useal (by img tag) in your html page.
3. Place your challenge string in hidden input form.
3. Catch the input from the form and send back to reCAPTCHA API to get the validation answer.

To run this process you can use this RecaptchaNonJs library in PHP or Python.
